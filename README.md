## Asif Hafeez

I'm a salesperson turned codeperson/elite hacker. A graduate of Manchester University and traveller of the world, I've worked in a variety of jobs, most of which have been customer facing and sales based. After graduating from Makers Academy, I'm hoping to further my dip in the coding world by diving straight into a new job, writing some good clean tested code, picking up a few new programming languages, working in an agile team which loves pair programming and solving problems in innovative and creative ways.
