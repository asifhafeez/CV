## Profile
Problem solver, curious learner, elite hacker and happy soul. People have called me a number of things over the years. In essence, I am a Full Stack Software Developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy, Europe's leading developer boot camp. 

In a previous life, I went to Manchester university, traveled to exotic new lands and sold life insurance (not so exotic). After making the decision to become a programmer, I expected the move from customer facing sales to junior developer to be difficult. However, by combining technical skills with my other transferable abilities, I have managed to turn myself into a fantastic knowledge worker.

I'm looking to work for a company which will allow me to write some good clean tested code, work in an agile team and solve problems using innovative and creative methods.

## Skills

#### Able communicator

After 16 weeks of pair programming, I understand how this is the number one transferable skill to have for a developer. 

3 years of experience in insurance sales has propelled my ability to communicate. I mastered the ability to deal with customers by converting long confusing insurance policy documents into easy to understand spiels. I spoke to over 15 different clients a day and developed a certain way of articulating my thoughts that makes it easier for people to digest what I am saying and allows them to respond honestly. 

#### Passionate Learner

I taught English in Egypt and the children I was teaching inspired me to learn how to code. Their enthusiasm to discover English helped me realise that I could learn anything if I put my mind to it. While grappling with HTML and CSS part-time, I found myself positively impassioned, this led me to invest in my learning and apply to Makers Academy. 

At Makers Academy, I embraced the new intense learning environment with tenacity and realised my lust for learning. For my final project, I worked alongside my team to learn Java and built a fully functioning Amazon Alexa Skill. Java was chosen because I wanted to learn something completely different from the course syllabus which mainly focuses on Ruby and Javascript.

#### Persistent Problem Solver

I continue working until a goal is achieved and when faced with a problem, I work away at it until I figure out a solution. I also motivate my colleagues to do the same. This led to multiple "Salesperson of the Month" awards during my time at Union Income Benefit. 

In terms of programming, I research thoroughly when stuck on a problem. I google repeatedly before asking on a forum or chatroom for help. If this doesn't work, I ask my colleagues or mentors and then ensure that I note down the answer before moving on. 

#### Caring Mentor

Pair programming for 12 weeks at Makers Academy has led me to the stage where I now feel comfortable helping others who are at the beginning of their software development journey. Teaching English in Cairo, supervising other waiters at Manchester United and motivating my team to hit sales targets at Union Income Benefit have all contributed to me mastering this very important skill.
